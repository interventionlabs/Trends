    Iterate over all tweets in each of the 100 collections.
    Each tweet has to be categorized into a topic.

    As each hashtag normally falls into one category, try to find percentage match to a topic and assign
    all tweets in the collection to the best matched topic.

    For mentions, each tweet is independently categorized into a topic.

    Also while iterating, find the best tweet that matches a topic, for each topic.
    This can be used to summarize the topic in the homepage.
