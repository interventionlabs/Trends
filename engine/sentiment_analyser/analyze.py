    Find the sentiment for the tweets belonging to the top 100 entities.

    Use common sentiment analysis techniques.
    All the data related has to be saved under sentiment_analyser/data like words list, emoticons or whatever is
    required.

    The information should be dumped into the respective collection of the entity.
    This can be done just after pooling but before it is dumped, so the new collections will have additional keys
    compared to the raw collection.
